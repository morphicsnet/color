# Color Axioms: Neurosymbolic From Color Geometry

## Abstract
This page summarizes the axiomatic underpinnings that connect color geometry with neurosymbolic reasoning. It is an auto-generated structured stub; replace this section with an 80–120 word abstract distilled from the source PDF.

## Key Concepts
- Color geometry axioms and structural assumptions
- Symbolic interfaces over geometric primitives
- Consistency and soundness considerations
- Links into validation, verification, and proof

## Methods and Results
- Outline core axiom statements and their roles.
- Summarize how axioms constrain mappings to percepts and symbols.
- Indicate any formal properties, lemmas, or theorems.
- Describe evaluation or validation strategies.
- Note: Auto-generated skeleton; curate with content from the PDF.
