# Color Geometry for Symbol Grounding

## Abstract
This page presents how color geometry supports the grounding of symbolic terms. It is an auto-generated structured stub; replace with an 80–120 word abstract.

## Key Concepts
- From symbols to percepts via geometry
- Regions, metrics, and prototypes
- Grounded mappings and their properties

## Methods and Results
- Describe mapping construction and constraints.
- Summarize evaluation and comparisons.
- Note: Auto-generated skeleton; curate with content from the PDF.

## Figures
- Placeholder for extracted figures. After extraction, embed as:
