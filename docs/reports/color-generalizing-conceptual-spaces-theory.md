# Color: Generalizing Conceptual Spaces Theory

## Abstract
This page outlines how the conceptual spaces framework is generalized using insights from color geometry. It is an auto-generated structured stub; replace with an 80–120 word abstract from the source.

## Key Concepts
- Dimensions, metrics, and topology of conceptual spaces
- Prototype effects and category boundaries
- Mapping principles for grounded color concepts

## Methods and Results
- Summarize the theoretical generalizations.
- Highlight formal or empirical support.
- Discuss implications for symbol grounding.
- Note: Auto-generated skeleton; curate with content from the PDF.

## Figures
