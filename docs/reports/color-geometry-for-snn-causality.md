# Color Geometry for SNN Causality

## Abstract
This page summarizes causal analyses for spiking neural networks within color geometry. It is an auto-generated structured stub; replace with an 80–120 word abstract.

## Key Concepts
- Spiking models in grounded color tasks
- Causal interventions and invariants
- Links from geometry to causal assertions

## Methods and Results
- Describe model setups and datasets.
- Summarize causal tests and metrics.
- Outline verification artifacts produced.
- Note: Auto-generated skeleton; curate with content from the PDF.
