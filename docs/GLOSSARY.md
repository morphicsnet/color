## Terms (A–Z)

- CGIR (Color Geometry Intermediate Representation)
  - A structured IR for color geometry workflows.
  - See: [docs/methods/cgir-ir.md](./methods/cgir-ir.md)

- Conceptual Space
  - A metric space whose regions represent concepts and categories.
  - See: [docs/theory/conceptual-spaces.md](./theory/conceptual-spaces.md)

- OKLab
  - A perceptually meaningful color space used for geometry and mixing.
  - See: [docs/methods/oklab-methods.md](./methods/oklab-methods.md)

- Symbol Grounding
  - The problem of connecting symbolic terms to percepts and actions.
  - See: [docs/foundations/symbol-grounding-basics.md](./foundations/symbol-grounding-basics.md)

- SNN (Spiking Neural Network)
  - Networks that process information using spikes over time.
  - See: [docs/theory/neurons-and-causality.md](./theory/neurons-and-causality.md)

- Causality (in SNNs)
  - Analyzing cause–effect relationships in spiking systems.
  - See: [docs/advanced/causality-in-snn.md](./advanced/causality-in-snn.md)

- OKLCh
  - Cylindrical OKLab representation (L, C, h).
  - See: [docs/methods/oklab-methods.md](./methods/oklab-methods.md)

- Prototype
  - Central exemplar of a category in conceptual spaces.
  - See: [docs/theory/conceptual-spaces.md](./theory/conceptual-spaces.md)

- Region (in conceptual spaces)
  - A set of points representing a concept or category.
  - See: [docs/theory/conceptual-spaces.md](./theory/conceptual-spaces.md)

- Metric (distance function)
  - Function defining distances for similarity/grounding.
  - See: [docs/theory/conceptual-spaces.md](./theory/conceptual-spaces.md)

- CGIR Pipeline
  - Flow from PDFs → IR → tools → proofs → webapp.
  - See: [docs/symbol-grounding/d3-cgir-pipeline.md](./symbol-grounding/d3-cgir-pipeline.md)

- Geometric Semantics
  - Semantics grounded in geometric structures like OKLab.
  - See: [docs/advanced/oklab-geometric-semantics.md](./advanced/oklab-geometric-semantics.md)

- Embodied Interaction
  - Interaction paradigms that reflect grounded semantics in UI.
  - See: [docs/symbol-grounding/d5-webapp-embodied-interaction.md](./symbol-grounding/d5-webapp-embodied-interaction.md)

- Verification vs Validation
  - Validation checks inputs/schemas; verification proves properties.
  - See: [docs/methods/verification-and-validation.md](./methods/verification-and-validation.md)

- Extraction (Coq)
  - Producing executable artifacts from proofs/specifications.
  - See: [docs/implementations/coq/extraction.md](./implementations/coq/extraction.md)
