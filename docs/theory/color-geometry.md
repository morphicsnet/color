# Color Geometry as a Grounding Space

Examine color geometry as the substrate for grounding symbolic color terms.

## Table of Contents
- Axioms and structure
- Mapping to perception
- From geometry to symbols

## Axioms and structure
Core axioms and structural assumptions.
See report: [docs/reports/color-axioms-neurosymbolic-from-color-geometry.md](../reports/color-axioms-neurosymbolic-from-color-geometry.md)

## Mapping to perception
Describe perceptual correspondences.

## From geometry to symbols
Relate geometric regions to symbol assignments.
