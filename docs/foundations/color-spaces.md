# Color Spaces and OKLab Basics

OKLab provides a perceptually meaningful geometry that supports robust grounding.

## Table of Contents
- From RGB to OKLab
- Perceptual uniformity
- Limitations and assumptions

## From RGB to OKLab
Motivation for moving from device-centric spaces to perceptual spaces.
See methods: [docs/methods/oklab-methods.md](../methods/oklab-methods.md)

## Perceptual uniformity
Discuss uniformity and implications for metric-based reasoning.

## Limitations and assumptions
Caveats and modeling assumptions.
