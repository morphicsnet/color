# Foundations Overview

This page introduces the symbol grounding problem and motivates color geometry as a concrete grounding space.

## Table of Contents

## What is symbol grounding?
Define the problem at a high level and set expectations for the learning pathway.

## Why color geometry?
Explain the benefits of OKLab and color geometry as a perceptual, structured space.
