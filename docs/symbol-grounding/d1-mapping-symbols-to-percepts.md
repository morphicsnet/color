# Mapping Symbols to Percepts

Explore representational choices that connect symbolic labels to perceptual structures in color geometry.

## Table of Contents
- Representational choices
- Color labels to geometry
- Cross-links

## Representational choices
Discuss options for mapping symbols to perceptual feature spaces.

## Color labels to geometry
Outline how symbolic color terms correspond to regions and prototypes.
